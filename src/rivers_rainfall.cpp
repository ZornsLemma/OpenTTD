/** This function makes a river wider at one particular tile, and at the same time generates a wider valley at this point if the configuration suggests doing this.
 *
 *  Both for wider rivers and for wider valleys we use a scheme, where in an alternating manner tiles at both sides of the rivers are chosen and processed.
 *  E.g., if you have tiles 000T000 (with T being the start tile, 0 being neighbor tiles along some axis, 1 being processed tiles), then we might process tiles in
 *  the following order: 001T000, 001T100, 011T100, 011T110, 111T110, 111T111.
 *
 *  Technically, the function receives a tuple (dx, dy), where either dx or dy must be zero, and starts by applying the component that is not zero to the respective
 *  coordinate of TileX / TileY.
 *
 *  Wider rivers and valleys are produced in the same loop of the above scheme.  First, we choose tiles according to the river width, and all later iterations of
 *  the tile choosing loop make the valley wider.  The latter works by maintaining a current height offset, which is increased in a probabilistic manner to
 *  get not too regular looking valleys.  That probabilistic scheme works as follow:  In the first step, increase height with probability 1 / desired_valley_width,
 *  in the second step with probability 2 / desired_valley_width, and so on until the whole desired valley width is processed.  This might lead to a scheme like,
 *  river tile has height 8, extra valley tiles have height 8,8,9,10,10,11, i.e. we let the terrain ascend towards the slope of the valley, and ascending is the
 *  more probable the farer we are away from the river.
 *
 *  With respect to wider rivers, the default behaviour is to simply ignore tiles that cannot be made a river (as they are already one, or are sea tiles), but
 *  if number_of_alternatives > 0 are given, the function will instead try to choose another tile according to the algorithm described above, until the number
 *  of alternatives are exhausted.  This is for avoiding situations, where a wide river flows along a map edge, and suddendly becomes quite small just because
 *  the first chosen tile would be outside the map.
 *
 *  @param tile the water tile
 *  @param dx size of first step in x direction, if not zero, it should be 1 or -1, and if not zero, dy must be zero
 *  @param dy size of first step in y direction, if not zero, it should be 1 or -1, and if not zero, dx must be zero
 *  @param desired_width desired width of the river
 *  @param desired_height desired height of the river
 *  @param desired_slope desired slope of the river
 *  @param number_of_alternatives number of extra tries if a tile is not suitable for water, until we give up.

/** This function aims at making rivers with huge flow wider.  The background is just: The Amazonas is a bit wider than the small
 *  river in your backyard.
 *
 *  The width of a river as generated by this function is a logarithmic function of its flow.  For this purpose, in the settings
 *  a multiplier is defined which is iteratively multiplied with the water flow necessary to form a river at all.
 *  Example: If the water flow necessary for a river is 300, and the multiplier is ten, then rivers with flow greater than 3000
 *  will be made two tiles wide by this function, rivers with flow greater than 30000 three tiles wide, and so on.
 *
 *  By using such a logarithmic approach, the danger that a river with huge flow exceeds all bounds and becomes maybe some dozens
 *  of tiles wide doesnÂ´t exist.
 *
 *  @param water_flow the water flow as calculated before
 *  @param water_info the status information (where are rivers, flow direction, etc.) as calculated before
 *  @param water_tiles the tiles declared water so far, this function will only inspect such tiles

 *  value will *not* be overwritten again in this step.  Thus, we get a mosaic of bigger

 *  the default value 500 (i.e. half the default width) afterwards.  This way, things get
 *  less random if the wider_valleys_randomness is decreased.  The default value 1000 is
 *  chosen such that each index will in average be attempted to be written two times.
 *  But... things are random.
 *
 *  Then, in two further steps, bigger and smaller sections of the grid are altered by
 *  applying some bigger or smaller offset, that is also chosen in a random manner.
 *  This way, the bigger wider_valleys_randomness is, the more diverse the values will
 *  become, as the areas overwrite each other more often.
 *

 * to the current height.

/** This function is meant to be called as very last step of river calculation, just before the tiles are actually declared water.
 *  Up to here, various algorithms have set up a picture about what tiles are planned to be rivers and lakes.  That picture is
 *  stored in the water_info array.
 *
 *  The problem is: Water may only be placed on flat or inclined (slope NW, NE, SW, SE) tiles.  But as those algorithms address the
 *  problem of river and lake generation from quite different perspectives, they cannot rule out the case that water is planned
 *  on inappropriate slopes completely.  For example, on an 1024x1024 map of the European Alps, at this point about 800 to 1000 tiles
 *  will be planned as water, but have an inappropriate slope.
 *
 *  The code which actually declares tiles water (remember, up to here, we only registered "make it water later"-decisions in the
 *  water-info array) is safe against incorrect slopes.  Thus, river generation will not crash because of such tiles, but rivers
 *  will have ugly looking gaps.
 *
 *  The task of this function is terraforming landscape on the small scale, until only planned water tiles with correct slope exist.

/** The generator function.  The following steps are performed in this order when generating rivers:

 *  (3) Recalculate HeightIndex and NumberOfLowerTiles, as step (2) performed terraforming, and thus invalidated them.
 *  (4) Calculate flow.  Each tiles gains one unit of flow, while flowing downwards, it sums up.
 *  (5) Modify flow paths, to make the result look like rivers with curves and corners, and not like straight channels.
 *  (6) Define lakes, i.e. decide which lake covers which tiles, and decide about the lake surface height.
 *  (7) Prepare rivers and lakes.  Add additional corner tiles to rivers, if flow is diagonal.  Terraform to lake surface height.
 *  (8) Generate wider rivers and valleys.
 *  (9) Find problem tiles, i.e. tiles whose slope is not suitable for becoming river.
 * (10) Try to fix them using terraforming on the small scale.  Do (among a number of possible actions) what fixes most problem tiles.
 * (11) Try to fix them by moving them, or by declaring them no water if they are not necessary for keeping the river connected.
 * (12) Lower tiles with not yet valid slope, until they are suitable for river.
 * (13) Improve bad inclined river slopes, i.e. (some of) those that have no direct upper or lower counterpart.
 * (14) Derive logical rivers.  Used for fine tuning like preventing upwards flow.  Might be useful for generating river names.
 * (15) Set up connections between the logical rivers.
 * (16) Get rid of rivers flowing upwards.
 * (17) Link rivers with the ocean.
 * (18) Raise lower terrain near rivers, to avoid the picture of "why doesnÂ´t it flow down there?"
 * (19) Another final call to lowering tiles until valid for rivers.
